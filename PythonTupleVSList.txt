Difference Between List and Tuple
                     List
1.List is changeable
2.Lists consume more memory
3.Lists have several built-in methods
4.Lists are enclosed in brackets ( [ ] ) and their elements and size can be changed
5.The implication of iterations is Time-consuming
6.The list is better for performing operations, such as insertion and deletion.



                          Tuple
1.Tuple is unchangeable
2.Tuple consumes less memory as compared to the list
3.Tuple does not have many built-in methods.
4.Tuples are enclosed in parentheses ( ( ) ) and cannot be updated. 
5.The implication of iterations is comparatively Faster
6.Tuple data type is appropriate for accessing the elements
